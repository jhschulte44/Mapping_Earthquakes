# Mapping Earthquake Data
## Project Overview
For this project, we were tasked with mapping earthquake GeoJson data with JavaScript. We were able to create 3 seperate map tiles to choose from, and included 3 layer options to show the earthquake data from the last seven days, the tectonic plates around which they occured, and seperated out any earthquake with a magnitude over 5.
